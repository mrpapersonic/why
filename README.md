# why
this pretty much justs trashes `HKLM\Software`, haven't found a good use for it though

dependencies:
```
gcc
binutils
mt
```

i'd recommend using [msys2](https://www.msys2.org/) to install gcc and binutils

mt can be obtained from [here](https://github.com/mrpapersonic/mt)

i am not responsible for any damage done with this code
